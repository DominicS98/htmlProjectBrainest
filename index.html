        <h2>What is Linux?</h2>
        <article>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. 
        Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution. It's main components are the distribution and the desktop environments.</article>
        <h2>Why would I use Linux?</h2>
        <article>
            This is the one question that most people ask. Why bother learning a completely different computing environment, when the operating system that ships with most desktops, laptops, and servers works just fine?
            To answer that question, I would pose another question. Does that operating system you’re currently using really work “just fine”? Or, do you find yourself battling obstacles like viruses, malware, slow downs, crashes, costly repairs, and licensing fees?
            If you struggle with the above, Linux might be the perfect platform for you. Linux has evolved into one of the most reliable computer ecosystems on the planet. 
            Combine that reliability with zero cost of entry and you have the perfect solution for a desktop platform.        
            That’s right, zero cost of entry... as in free. You can install Linux on as many computers as you like without paying a cent for software or server licensing.
        </article>
        <article>Linux is also distributed under an open source license. Open source follows these key tenants:</article>
        <ul>
            <li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</li>
            <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.</li>
            <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</li>
            <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</li>


        </ul>
        <h2>Ok! How can I install Linux?</h2>
        <section>Linux has a number of different
            <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Linux_Distribution_Timeline_21_10_2021.svg">distros</a>
            to suit any type of user. From new users to hard-core users, you’ll find a “flavor” of Linux to match your needs. These versions are called distributions (or, in the short form, “distros”). 
            Nearly every distribution of Linux can be downloaded for free, burned onto disk (or USB thumb drive), and installed (on as many machines as you like).</section>
        <article>Before installing it, you first need to choose a flavor of it. Just like Windows has Windows XP, Vista and 11, with it's "Pro", "Home" and "Educational" variants, Linux has it's own community-driven distros.</article>
