      <h1>The three main linux distros</h1>
      <section>
        There are 3 main Linux distributions, Debian, Fedora and Arch. Most of
        the popular distros in use today are forks or flavors of those three.

          Most famous distro, as Ubuntu is build on top of it. It provides a
          stable experience, but some packages may be quite old. The system
          update scheme is maintained with stability in mind, so you would need
          to update your system every couple of months.

          Debian is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux
          kernel. The project is coordinated over the Internet by a team of
          volunteers guided by the Debian Project Leader and three foundational
          documents: the Debian Social Contract, the Debian Constitution, and
          the Debian Free Software Guidelines. New distributions are updated
          continually, and the next candidate is released after a time-based
          freeze.

          Arch Linux uses a rolling release model, meaning there are no "major
          releases" of completely new versions of the system; a regular system
          update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software. So,
          you will always have the latest software on your computer, but there
          are some ricky updates that may break some dependencies, and you find
          yourself without sound or keyboard support.

          Think of Fedora as a combination of these two, it has constant
          releases, but also major ones like Debian. The main characteristic of
          Fedora is it's more entreprise-friendly structure, especially for
          server arhitectures.
